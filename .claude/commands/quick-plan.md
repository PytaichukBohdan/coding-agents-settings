# Quick Plan

Create a detailed implementation plan based on the user's requirements provided through the `USER_PROMPT` variable. Analyze the request, think through the implementation approach, and save a comprehensive specification document to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<name-of-plan>.md` that can be used as a blueprint for actual development work.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $ARGUMENTS
PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: `specs/`

## Instructions

- Carefully analyze the user's requirements provided in the USER_PROMPT variable
- Think deeply (ultrathink) about the best approach to implement the requested functionality or solve the problem
- Create a concise implementation plan that includes:
  - Clear problem statement and objectives
  - Technical approach and architecture decisions
  - Step-by-step implementation guide
  - Potential challenges and solutions
  - Testing strategy
  - Success criteria
- Generate a descriptive, kebab-case filename based on the main topic of the plan
- Save the complete implementation plan to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<descriptive-name>.md`
- Ensure the plan is detailed enough that another developer could follow it to implement the solution
- Include code examples or pseudo-code where appropriate to clarify complex concepts
- Consider edge cases, error handling, and scalability concerns
- Structure the document with clear sections and proper markdown formatting

## Workflow

1. Analyze Requirements - THINK HARD and parse the USER_PROMPT to understand the core problem and desired outcome
2. Design Solution - Develop technical approach including architecture decisions and implementation strategy
3. Document Plan - Structure a comprehensive markdown document with problem statement, implementation steps, and testing approach
4. Generate Filename - Create a descriptive kebab-case filename based on the plan's main topic
5. Save & Report - Write the plan to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<filename>.md` and provide a summary of key components

## Plan Format

Follow this format when creating implementation plans:

```md
# Plan: <task name>

## Task Description
<describe the task in detail based on the prompt>

## Objective
<clearly state what will be accomplished when this plan is complete>

## Problem Statement
<clearly define the specific problem or opportunity this task addresses>

## Solution Approach
<describe the proposed solution approach and how it addresses the objective>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to complete the task:

<list files relevant to the task with bullet points explaining why. Include new files to be created under an h3 'New Files' section if needed>

## Implementation Phases
IMPORTANT: Each phase should be a checkbox that will be checked off during implementation. Include Status and Comments fields for tracking progress.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation** - <describe any foundational work needed>
  - Status:
  - Comments:

- [ ] **Phase 2: Core Implementation** - <describe the main implementation work>
  - Status:
  - Comments:

- [ ] **Phase 3: Integration & Polish** - <describe integration, testing, and final touches>
  - Status:
  - Comments:

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom. Each task should be a checkbox that will be checked off during implementation. Include Status and Comments fields for tracking progress.

<list step by step tasks as checkboxes with h3 headers for grouping. Format each task as:>
- [ ] **Task description** - <detailed explanation>
  - Status:
  - Comments:

<Use h3 headers to organize tasks by category. Start with foundational changes then specific implementation. Last step should validate the work.>

### 1. <Category Name>
- [ ] **<Task Name>** - <specific action>
  - Status:
  - Comments:

### 2. <Category Name>
- [ ] **<Task Name>** - <specific action>
  - Status:
  - Comments:

<continue with additional tasks as needed>

## Testing Strategy
<describe testing approach, including unit tests and edge cases as applicable>

## Acceptance Criteria
<list specific, measurable criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete>

## Validation Commands
Execute these commands to validate the task is complete:

<list specific commands to validate the work. Be precise about what to run>
- Example: `uv run python -m py_compile src/*.py` - Test to ensure the code compiles

## Notes
<optional additional context, considerations, or dependencies. If new libraries are needed, specify using `uv add`>
```

## Report

After creating and saving the implementation plan, provide a concise report with the following format:

```
✅ Implementation Plan Created

File: PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<filename>.md
Topic: <brief description of what the plan covers>
Key Components:
- <main component 1>
- <main component 2>
- <main component 3>
